&#x1F469;&#x200D;&#x1F4BB; I am a full-stack software developer with 18 years of experience in building enterprise-level applications and integrations. I have a proven record for delivering innovative and creative solutions on time and under budget. I've written software for a wide variety of industries but my biggest areas have been in higher education (user portals, SIS and LMS integrations) and ERP/LOB applications (focused in the fire & life safety industry).</p>

&#x1F308; I am an open and proud transgender woman. I strive everyday to be the most authentic version of myself, and I try to inspire and empower others to do the same. I do the best I can to treat everyone with compassion and empathy, and I try leave the world a better place than how I found it.</p>
